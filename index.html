          <h2>What is kimchi?</h2>
          <p>
            Indeed, this low-fat and high-fiber meal is so famous it’s widely
            available in Asian grocery stores and health food stores all over
            the country. But, what exactly is kimchi? Kimchi is a red, fermented
            cabbage dish (occasionally, with radish) made with a mix of salt,
            vinegar, garlic, chile peppers and other spices. These ingredients
            are fermented in a tightly closed jar and are subsequently served
            with rice, noodles or soups in every Korean’s household.
            So, why should you let this spicy meal enter your mouth? Here are
            nine benefits of kimchi you can pass on to your friends:
          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="benefit">
          <h2 id="1">1. Contains healthy bacteria and probiotics for the overall
            wellness of your body</h2>
          <p>
            Because kimchi is fermented, like yogurt, it contains “healthy
            bacteria” called lactobacilli that aids in the digestion process of
            your body. Another amazing by-product of its fermentation process
            are the probiotics can also fight off various infections in your
            body.
           </p>
        </div>

        <div class="benefit">
          <h2 id="2">2. Lowers cholesterol levels</h2>
          <p>
            If you’re suffering from high blood pressure or a high cholesterol
            amount in your blood, don’t fret. The garlic found in kimchi
            contains allicin and selenium – both of which are helpful in
            decreasing the cholesterol reserves of the body. In addition,
            these substances also indirectly help you prevent chances of
            developing stroke or other cardiovascular diseases of any kind,
            due to its prevention of plaque build-up in the walls of your
            arteries.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="benefit">
          <h2 id="3">3. Facilitates healthy body development and clear vision</h2>
          <p>
            A 100-gram serving of kimchi has 18% of the daily value of vitamin
            A, if we consider the 2,000-calorie per day diet. Aside from vitamin
            A being an antioxidant which can help get rid of free radicals in
            your body that cause cancer, the benefits of kimchi are not limited
            to this only. This same vitamin A is significant in developing a
            healthy body, including in embryos; it’s also helpful in the
            maintenance of clear and healthy eyesight.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="benefit">
          <h2 id="4">4. Produces radiant skin and shiny hair</h2>
          <p>
            Kimchi doesn’t just make your inner beauty shine through – it makes
            your outer appearance appear excellent as well. Because the selenium
            found in garlic in kimchi keeps your skin and hair healthy, eating
            kimchi helps you prevent wrinkles in the long run. Also, selenium is
            a relevant part of glutathione, a booster that reconstitutes vitamin
            C and preserves it, thereby making it stronger and more effective in
            the body.

        <div class="benefit">
          <h2 id="5">5. Prevents stomach cancer</h2>
          <p>
            Professor Miri Kim of the Food Nutrition Department in Chungnam
            National University discovered Chinese cabbage and radish found in
            kimchi contain bio-chemicals such as isocyanate and sulfide helpful
            in detoxifying heavy metals found in your liver, small intestine and
            kidney. These bio-chemicals, particularly isocyanate, are studied to
            be able to prevent stomach cancer as well.

        <div class="benefit">
          <h2 id="6">6. Slows down the aging process</h2>
          <p>
            Ever wondered why Koreans look young for their age? This is just one
            of the many benefits of kimchi you can consider: kimchi, after two
            weeks of being fermented, is rich in anti-oxidants which decrease
            the rate of aging of the skin. It also inhibits cell oxidation,
            making you look carefree and relaxed, even though you’re under a lot
            of stress.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="benefit">
          <h2 id="7">7. Helps you lose weight</h2>
          <p>
            150 grams of kimchi contains only 40 calories. But it’s not limited
            to this – kimchi helps carbohydrate metabolism to aid you in losing
            weight. Additionally, the capsaicin found in chili peppers in this
            Korean dish boosts your metabolism and makes you use the excess
            energy in your body, thereby increasing weight loss.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="benefit">
          <h2 id="8">8. Prevents the occurrence of peptic ulcer</h2>
          <p>
            Peptic ulcer is commonly caused by Helicobacter pylori, a
            Gram-negative bacteria found in the stomach. How can we stop its
            growth? By eating kimchi. Kimchi contains leuconostoc mensenteroides
            which produce dextrin, a substance important to stop the growth of
            H. pylori in your body!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="benefit">
          <h2 id="9">9. Boosts your immunity</h2>
          <p>
            Professor Rina Yu of the Food and Nutrition Department in the
            University of Ulsan found out kimchi causes the immune cells to be
            more active and the antibodies to be more abundant. Eating a high
            cholesterol diet can give 55% immune cell activity, a normal diet
            can give 68% but a high cholesterol diet plus kimchi can give 75%.
